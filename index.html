            <h3>Topographical Features Extraction from Satellite Images</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on the extracion of topographical features from satellite images. Utlizing deep learning techniques and advanced image processing, we have developed a model that processes input images, such as satellite images from Google Maps, and outputs images with highlighted topographical features. Throughout this project, we have applied various image preprocessing techniques, including pacifying, normalizing, rendering, and processing labels, as well as creating training and test sets. We implemented deep learning methodologies such as the Jaccard coefficient and the U-Net model. The model was trained, saved, and used for predicions.</p>
