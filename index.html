            <h3>Northern Lights-Dream Place to visit </h3>
            <p>This project focuses on CSS styling to enhance the aesthetics of a travel-themed webpage. I designed a table that showcases different countries along with the best time to visit for experiencing the Northern Lights. To create a visually appealing layout, I used linear gradients to add multiple colors to the headings and incorporated subtle background shading to align with the Northern Lights theme. These design elements not only improve readability but also contribute to a cohesive and immersive user experience, demonstrating the effective use of CSS techniques for styling and presentation.

            <h3>Topographical Features Extraction from Satellite Images</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on the extracion of topographical features from satellite images. Utlizing deep learning techniques and advanced image processing, we have developed a model that processes input images, such as satellite images from Google Maps, and outputs images with highlighted topographical features. Throughout this project, we have applied various image preprocessing techniques, including pacifying, normalizing, rendering, and processing labels, as well as creating training and test sets. We implemented deep learning methodologies such as the Jaccard coefficient and the U-Net model. The model was trained, saved, and used for predicions.</p>
